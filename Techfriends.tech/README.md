# Project README

## Reminder

1. **Always add clear comments explaining any code or config changes.**
2. **For each new project or experiment, open a completely separate folder and initialize a new repository.**
   - Never mix files from different projects in the same directory or commit.
   - This keeps project histories clean and prevents accidental merges.
